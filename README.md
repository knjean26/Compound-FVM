# Compound-FVM

This directory includes byte.txt and interface.json for each contract
We use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) in dealing with constructor and compiling each contract

Check this [LINK](https://github.com/knjean26/FVM_Compound_protocol/blob/main/src/test/test_sh/README.md) to follow the step on how to create and run contract in Firovm.

Firovm source code can be found in this [LINK](https://github.com/nopslide/Firovm)
